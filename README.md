## What's this all about? 🤔
Chronodate is a fun bot that posts the current year's progress every single day.
Something like:
```
2024 is 87% complete.

▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░
```
That's it for now! But I'm already planning some cool updates:

* **Memory features**: Let the bot "remember" and reference past posts or interactions.
* **Advanced interactions**: Think reminders or custom responses!
* **A basic website**: Because why not? Every bot deserves a home.
  
For now, I'm just happy to share this project with the world.

## Why make this public? 💡
Honestly, this is an act of good faith. I believe in sharing fun, creative ideas with the community, and Chronodate felt like the perfect project to start with.
